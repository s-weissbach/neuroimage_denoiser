    A wrapper class for a U-Net model used for denoising 3D image sequences.

        weights (str): Path to the pre-trained weights.
        batch_size (int): Number of frames to process in each batch.
        cpu (bool): Flag to force CPU usage, even if a GPU is available.
        device (torch.device): Device to use for computations (GPU or CPU).
        model (UNet): The U-Net model instance.
        denoised_img (np.ndarray): The denoised image sequence.
        img (np.ndarray): The input image sequence.
